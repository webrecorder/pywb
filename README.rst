Web Archiving Tools for All
---------------------------

`View the full pywb documentation <https://pywb.readthedocs.org>`_

**pywb** is a Python (2 and 3) web archiving toolkit for replaying web archives large and small as accurately as possible.
The toolkit now also includes new features for creating high-fidelity web archives.

This toolset forms the foundation of Webrecorder project, but also provides a generic web archiving toolkit
that is used by other web archives, including the traditional "Wayback Machine" functionality.


New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The 2.x release included a major overhaul of pywb and introduces many new features, including the following:

* Dynamic multi-collection configuration system with no-restart updates.

* New recording capability to create new web archives from the live web or other archives.

* Componentized architecture with standalone Warcserver, Recorder and Rewriter components.

* Support for Memento API aggregation and fallback chains for querying multiple remote and local archival sources.

* HTTP/S Proxy Mode with customizable certificate authority for proxy mode recording and replay.

* Flexible rewriting system with pluggable rewriters for different content-types.

* Standalone, modular `client-side rewriting system (wombat.js) <https://github.com/webrecorder/wombat>`_ to handle most modern web sites.

* Improved 'calendar' query UI with incremental loading, grouping results by year and month, and updated replay banner.

* Extensible UI customizations system for modifying all aspects of the UI.

* Robust access control system for blocking or excluding URLs, by prefix or by exact match.

* New in 2.6: Access Control embargo and http-header control access settings.

* New in 2.6: Support for localization and multi-language deployment.

* New in 2.7: New banner/calendar UI written in `Vue <https://vuejs.org/>`_, with interactive timeline and easier theming of colors and logo via ``config.yaml``.


Please see the `full documentation <https://pywb.readthedocs.org>`_ for more detailed info on all these features.

To install pywb for usage, you can use:

``pip install pywb``

Note: depending on your Python installation, you may have to use `pip3` instead of `pip`.

``git clone https://github.com/webrecorder/pywb``

To install from a locally cloned copy, install with ``pip install -e .`` or ``python setup.py install``.

To run tests, we recommend installing ``pip install tox tox-current-env`` and then running ``tox --current-env`` to test in your current Python environment.

To Build docs locally, run:  ``cd docs; make html``. (The docs will be built in ``./_build/html/index.html``)
